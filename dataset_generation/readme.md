# Facial dataset generation from youtube
Written three python scripts to generate datasets. Each video generated in the dataset is around
4-5seconds.
All the python scripts are customizable i.e, we can alter the code to generate video datasets of any
interval in any video. We download only the video, audio is not present.
Following are the three python scripts and their functionality:
1. youtube_video_links.py
Input - It needs a youtube API key and also a channel ID.
Output - It generates a .csv file where we get video links of all videos on that youtube channel,
sorted in the order of date and time published. The latest videos are at the top.

2. download_videos.py
Input - It takes the .csv file generated by the above script.
Output - It generates videos based on the number of videos you need.
Description - It uses the FFmpeg tool to download videos from a given youtube link and the
parameters such as length of the interval, the start of the interval can be set in the
code.
3. vid2frames.py
Input - It takes the folder of all the videos downloaded in the above code.
Output - It generates frames for each video and stores them in separate folders. It also generates .txt file where the path to every frame in that dataset is present.
